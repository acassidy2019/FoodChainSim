# FoodChainSim
Sprite-based environment simulator.
Main function found in EnvironmentalSim.java.

** NOTE **
As much as I would like to export as a runnable JAR file, the NetBeans IDE is packaging 
the JAR in a weird way.  I've tried manually changing the manifest files myself to identify a 
main entrypoint for the Jar, but there is still an error reported saying "no identified Main function 
in Main class".  Until the JAR is working, the only way to run this is as follows:
- Download the .zip file and extract wherever you like. 
- Navigate the folder structure to EnvironmentalSim.java
- Compile and run using java from the command line.

This will be updated with proper documentation in the future.
